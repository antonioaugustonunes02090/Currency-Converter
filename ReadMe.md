A little personal project of mine, where you should be able to select 3 different currencies and get their exchange rate to Brazilian Real (BRL). In this project, the following python libraries were used:  requests, json and streamlit; It was also used the API 'AwesomeAPI' to get the currency exchange rate.
Project on break;  
To run the code, you'll first need to download this code, and then input in your terminal:  
'>>>pip install streamlit' #If you don't have streamlit already installed in your machine  
'>>>streamlit run app.py'  
It's done.
